**##Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a **Linked List Implementation of Sparse Matrices** in C++. In sparse matrices, most elements are zero, so instead of using a full 2D array, we only store non-zero elements in a linked list to save memory.

Each node in the linked list stores:
- The row index
- The column index
- The non-zero value
- A pointer to the next node

This method ensures efficient memory usage and scalable representation of sparse matrices.

## Features

- Represent sparse matrix using singly linked list
- Only store non-zero elements
- Display full matrix (with 0s where needed)
- Memory-efficient design
- Dynamic insertion of elements
